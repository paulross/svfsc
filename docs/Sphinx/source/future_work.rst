Future Work
#################################################

A place to discuss, document and design future work on this project.

Read-through Cache
==================

Creating a class that takes, say, a callback function that can populate the cache without the caller doing so.

Write Cache
==================

Currently the design is a read cache, how about a read/write or read/write/update cache?
Will writing affect the block integrity checks?
